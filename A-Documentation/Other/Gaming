This section is dedicated to the many gamers of the tech world. Gaming on linux isnt all too easy considering linux doesnt feature full native EXE support and kernel level anticheat support as well.
You need to use either Wine or Proton Experimental in order to actually get half of your games to work on linux, and Wine in particular can be buggy at time (atleast in my experience)
This operating system will feature kernel level anticheat as an option for my beloved hardcore gamers. During installation, you get to choose whether you want the support for 
kernel level anticheat or increased security (no anticheat). I personally think this will be a great idea for both the gaming side and the work/developer side, as this gives
users more of a choice rather than take away the user's freedom. 

More to be added.
